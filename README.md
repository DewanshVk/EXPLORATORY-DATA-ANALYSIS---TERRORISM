# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS---TERRORISM
**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on the 'Global Terrorism' dataset.<br>
**Programming Language Utilized:** Python
During this internship, I had the privilege of immersing myself in the dataset, harnessing the power of data visualization to elucidate various aspects of terrorism-related inquiries. Through the art of visualization, I sought answers to pivotal questions, including:
- Identification of terrorism hotspots.
- Analysis of the evolution of terrorist incidents over time.
- Examination of prevalent attack types and their associated impact.
- Profiling major perpetrators of terrorism.
- Exploration of common targets and motives behind terrorist attacks.
- Compilation of total fatalities resulting from terror attacks.
